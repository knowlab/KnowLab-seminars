Before the presentation, everyone has the chance to share any quick updates on things like:
* Grant/Fellowship applications: Opportunities, Submissions, Applications shortlisted/received
* Research papers: Submissions, Revisions, Paper Accepted
* Communications: Issues to be solved amoung the group, calls for help

The main presenter will be give 15 min to share his/her own work or thoughts. Afterward, we have 10 minutes of discussion.
